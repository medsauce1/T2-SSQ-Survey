I then rewrite my physical notes in Microsoft Word (which allows me to review the material). While watching the lecture, I take physical notes, later on, I rewrite those notes in Microsoft Word (which again gives me the opportunity to review). I learn most of the content doing so. For more complicated or heavier content I may review by going over my notes the same week it was taught.
For midterms and tests, I simply put the time to rewatch as many lectures as possible (at least the important ones), and in the process of watching the lecture (or going over lecture notes if lecture recording isn't available), the information resurface.","As of March 25th, I have lost exactly 3.2% of my final grade.
